# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

FPS Aim Training 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where you click dots that appear on your screen as fast as you can.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project will contain a blank canvas where dots appear and the user is needed to click the dots as quickly as possible. The next dot will appear after the previous dot is clicked. The project will also contain a scoring system where each dot clicked gives you a point. There will also be a timer for one minute, so the end goal is to click as many dots as you can in one minute. We are using python to code this project. We plan to use python and use the pygame library.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Don't plan on double dipping

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for this project would be would be what as described in the paragraph above and I think we'll be able to accomplish that regardless. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of this project would be to somehow add a way for the user to adjust the size of the dots to his want. Also maybe a different mode that displays different sized dots and the smaller the dot the more points you get, but in this version, the dots will disappear after a few seconds. I think the ideas are obtainable but making a different mode may be difficult.
 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome will include everything in the better outcome but also include a music player. While using apps similar to the one we're creating. Listening to music is something many people like to do so a media player would be great to add.
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

With this project we will have to learn how to interpret the pygame library into our project. We'll have to learn how to make the canvas for the game. Also, we will have to learn how we can make a circle act as a button. We're currently unsure on who will do what but possible set of work could be one of us works on the games interface while other one works on the actual game.
